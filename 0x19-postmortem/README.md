My First Postmortem

Issue Summary:

On May 12th, 2023, from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM EST, users experienced slow response times and intermittent errors while using our web application. Approximately 80% of users were affected. The root cause was an issue with our database server.

Timeline:

2:00 PM: The issue was first detected by monitoring alerts indicating a high number of database errors.
2:10 PM: Engineers started investigating the issue and checked the database logs to identify the root cause.
2:30 PM: The assumption was made that the database server was running low on resources due to a recent increase in traffic and queries.
3:00 PM: The team focused on optimizing the database queries to reduce the load on the server.
4:00 PM: Despite query optimization, the issue persisted, and the team suspected a hardware issue.
4:30 PM: The incident was escalated to senior engineers and the database administrator team.
5:00 PM: The database administrator team identified a faulty disk in the RAID array that was causing the issue.
5:30 PM: The faulty disk was replaced, and the database server was back to normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was a faulty disk in the RAID array of our database server. This caused intermittent errors and slow response times, which affected approximately 80% of our users. The faulty disk was replaced, and the database server was back to normal operation.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, we will take the following corrective and preventative measures:

Implement proactive monitoring for the RAID array and disk health to detect issues before they affect users.
Implement redundant hardware configurations to ensure high availability and minimize the impact of hardware failures.
Conduct regular hardware maintenance to ensure the health and reliability of our infrastructure.
Task List:

Implement proactive monitoring for RAID array and disk health.
Conduct regular hardware maintenance to check the health of our infrastructure.
Implement redundant hardware configurations to ensure high availability.
In conclusion, the root cause of the issue was a faulty disk in the RAID array of our database server, which caused intermittent errors and slow response times. To prevent similar incidents in the future, we will implement proactive monitoring, redundant hardware configurations, and regular maintenance to ensure the health and reliability of our infrastructure.
